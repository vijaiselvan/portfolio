        <img src="./Profile.jpg" alt="Vijai Selvan" />
        <p>
          I'm a backend developer who doesn’t just write code — I build recovery
          paths, solve real-world data issues, and think in terms of system
          resilience and business impact. I specialize in clean, modular Spring
          Boot APIs backed by MongoDB, and have front-end experience designing
          responsive websites with modern HTML/CSS.

              <li>Processed and interpreted validation responses to perform internal checks (e.g., PO Box, postal code match, service-down indicators), driving downstream decisions based on address quality.</li>
              <li>Implemented Jackson-based data mappers to parse and normalize JSON/XML address validation responses, ensuring consistent data transformation across Dev, IT, UAT, and Prod environments.</li>
              <li>Applied business rules to scrub, standardize, and enrich address data before further processing or storage.</li>
              <li>Handled exceptions and service outages with Spring-managed error flows and custom exception classes, improving system resilience and reliability.</li>
              <li>Instrumented logging & auditing with SLF4J and centralized audit tables, improving traceability and accelerating root cause analysis.</li>
